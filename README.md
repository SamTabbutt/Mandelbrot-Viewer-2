# Mandelbrot-Viewer-2
This is an in-progress project I am working on to visualize and interact with complex dynamical systems

Welcome to the Mandelbrot Set Explorer The mandelbrot set is a fractal set which displays visually the long-term behavior of each point (c) on the complex plane under iterations of the function f(x)=x^2+c with the seed of the function x0=0. If a point is colored black, then it remains bound for n iterations of the function. All other colors represent different slopes of unboundedness.

This program has the ability to zoom into any point with magnification on the order of 10^10. Once you get deep enough, the java capability of distinguishing between points is lost, and you get distorted images.

To zoom, click and drag the mouse to create the new frame you would like to view. The initial click will set the upper-left corner of the new zoom frame. Drag down and to the right to make your frame. The frame will auto-adjust to keep the image display to have a real-to-imaginary aspect ratio of 1:1. Once you dive deeper, you may see less interesting activity. At this point you can turn the iteration setting up (which is available through a chooser displayed on the applet)

To the right of the mandelbrot set is a julia set viewer. The Julia set is associated with a single point of the complex plane. Tp set a new value to estalish the julia set, double-click on a point in the mandelbrot set viewframe. 

In its current state, this program is designed to explore the Mandelbrot set under rather strict operating conditions The program has initialized to display the set under 100 iterations in the complex plane from -2 through 1 on the real axis and -1.5 to 1.5 on the imaginary axis to zoom, create a zoom frame by clicking and dragging down and to the right. At a certain point, you may find that the detail is lost, at which point you can increase the iteration to enhance the definition in a small frame Enjoy exploring!
